    <h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
      House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a
      blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They are generally seen as a
      consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a
      house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso
      roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you
      should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark
      roast and have intermediate flavor.
