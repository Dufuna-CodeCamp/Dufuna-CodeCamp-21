Hello everyone! 
I am Lute Chongo and I am based in Zambia.
I am a curious and open minded individual who enjoys conversations.
I am excited to be a part of this program because I have the opportunity to become familiar with programming before venturing into my CS degre.
I intend to intern for BongoHive, PwC and many more companies that will peak my interest before starting my own.
I look forward to building good and impactful relationships with you all that will help us all grow!
