Hello World!

I'm Samuel M. Ortil an aspiring Software Engineer and I am very happy to be here.

At the end of the program, I hope to gain the necessary skills required to strive successfully and grow in the software engineering field. With these skills, I would love to build a lot of product that will help solve alot of challenges faced in the education sector and also contribute my quota to the training of other software engineers that will come after me. 

Thank you the Dufuna management/mentors for this opportunity.
