Hello Dufuna!
My name is Chijioke Orabueze.
By the end of this program, I hope to build an excellent skill in both backend and software development and gain insights from the numerous mentors and materials the program has offered.
Additionally, I hope to secure my first job as a Full Stack Developer in a great company.
