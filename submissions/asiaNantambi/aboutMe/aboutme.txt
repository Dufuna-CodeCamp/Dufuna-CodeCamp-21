Hello Dufuna,
I am Asia Nantambi a computer scientist from Uganda. I love tech, coding and playing chess.

I am here for the react module and i thank Dufuna team for the opportunity granted to me to learn more, improve my skills and meet new brains.

This is my second attempt for the aboutMe submission therefore changed the name of the branch from about-Asia to about-Asian.
