I am Elugbaju Paul, aspiring to be a fullstack developer by the end of these training modules.
I firstly appreciate Dufuna for the scholarship opportunity. Thank you for the privilege given to be better.
By the end of this training program, i will want to build not only static pages but real projects that are functional and can store and tranform data like user details.
I hope that the training modules will bring fulfillment to my expectations.
Thank you for the privilege once again, Team Dufuna!
