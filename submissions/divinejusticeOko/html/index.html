    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Very early than ever, the Korean company announced in mid-January the Galaxy S21 series, the flagship triple
        phones that come with a completely new design with a stylish camera that blends into the frame of the phone and
        the most powerful processor to date, the same case in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Galaxy S21 Ultra features
        support for Samsung's S Pen for the first time in the S series of phones, and it comes with the most diverse
        camera system and the most advanced feature set overall. The phone comes with a gigantic 5000mAh battery, which
        is a remarkably large phone, significantly larger than the average hand size of anyone. As big as it is, it is
        also big on price.</p>

    <p>The phone comes with a 6.8-inch AMOLED screen with a dynamic refresh rate from 10Hz to 120Hz that changes
        automatically according to the content. And for the first time in the Galaxy series phones, you will be able to
        operate the phone at a refresh rate of 120Hz along with the maximum resolution of QHD. Samsung has also
        improved screen brightness and contrast, which is now the brightest with a peak of 1,500 nits and 50% better
        contrast compared to last year's model.
        While the S21 and S21 Plus was launched in quite a few bold new colors, the Ultra was introduced in two fairly
        calm colors: silver and black.</p>
