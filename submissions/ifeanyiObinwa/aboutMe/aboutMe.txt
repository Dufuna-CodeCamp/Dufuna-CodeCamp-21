Hello World!

I am Ifeanyi Obinwa and I'm learning Software engineering on Dufuna.

I'm currently corp member serving in Lagos, and I hope that by the time I'd be done with my
service that I'd be good in Frontend web development.

I am grateful for Dufuna for this opportunity and I hope to make  maximum use of it.

Thank you.
