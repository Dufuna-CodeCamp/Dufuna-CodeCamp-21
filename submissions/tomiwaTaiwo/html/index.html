          <h4>Product Description</h4>
          <P>In the world of sneakers, few styles last. The ones that do are the true classics—the trends that graduate to staples. They’re consistently worn 
            by both footwear enthusiasts and the general public. For Nike, the shoes that sell shareholder-pleasing units tend to be white leather shoes like the dad-friendly Air Monarch line—ones that cool kids and connoisseurs hate. One rare example of such sneakers 
            that cross over into both worlds is the Nike Air Force 1 in its most popular, iconic style: low-cut, in all-white.</P>
            <P>AVAILABLE IN SIZE 38-44</P>
